Hey there! I'm Amrutha, a Data Science graduate with a passion for unlocking the magic of Machine Learning. Sure, ignorance can be bliss (think: mind-blown magic tricks!), but knowledge is the ultimate power-up. It has the potential to change the world, and that's what ignited my journey into Data Science.

When I'm not wrangling data, you can find me with my nose in a book 📚, catching the latest flicks 🎬, capturing moments through photography 📸, or exploring new horizons 🌍.

This GitHub is my playground for showcasing the projects I've been working on (and keep working on!) ✨. Stay tuned for exciting updates, and feel free to join the adventure! 🚀
